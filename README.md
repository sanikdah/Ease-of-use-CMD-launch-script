# About the project

This is just something I whipped up when I just wanted to make a script  
that would turn the text color of my Command Prompt to terminal green  
whenever I launch the Command Prompt. This is nothing fancy currently,  
lacking a good menu, completely lacking a help screen, and only having  
a placeholder tutorial.

# Warning

This project is still in beta and many things (especially the debug menu)  
are dangerous to either the script, your PC, or both.
