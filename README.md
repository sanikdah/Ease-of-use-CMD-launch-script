# About the project

This is just something I whipped up when I just wanted to make a script  
that would turn the text color of my Command Prompt to terminal green  
whenever I launch the Command Prompt. This is nothing fancy currently,  
lacking a good menu, completely lacking a help screen, and only having  
a placeholder tutorial.

# Warning

This project is still in beta and many things (especially the debug menu)  
are dangerous to either the script, your PC, or both.

# Setup

## Installing

### 1. Downloading

You will typically want to download the version from the releases section,  
as these are garunteed to at least work. However you can also get it directly  
from the source, for the essentially "beta" version. These might have more  
features that aren't in the latest release, typically because they are unfinished.

### 2. Installation

Now that you have the script downloaded, launch the script, and go through the  
[first time setup](#First-Time-Setup).
