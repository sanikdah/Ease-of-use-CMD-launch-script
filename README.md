# About the project

This is just something I whipped up when I just wanted to make a script  
that would turn the text color of my Command Prompt to terminal green  
whenever I run it.  This is nothing fancy currently, lacking a good  
menu, completely lacking a help screen, and only having a placeholder  
tutorial.
