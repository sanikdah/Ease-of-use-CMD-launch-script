# About the project

This is just something I whipped up when I just wanted to make a script  
that would turn the text color of my Command Prompt to terminal green  
whenever I launch the Command Prompt. This is nothing fancy currently,  
lacking a good menu, completely lacking a help screen, and only having  
a placeholder tutorial.

# Warning

This project is still in beta and many things (especially the debug menu)  
are dangerous to either the script, your PC, or both.

# Setup

## Installing

### 1. Downloading

You will typically want to download the version from the releases section,  
as these are garunteed to at least work. However you can also get it directly  
from the source, for the essentially "beta" version. These might have more  
features that aren't in the latest release, typically because they are unfinished.

### 2. Installation

Now that you have the script downloaded, launch the script, and go through the  
[first time setup](#First-Time-Setup).

## Customization

### 1. Ease of use (Part 1)

Now that you have launched the script, you can safely delete the downloaded file.  
You should now set it up for better ease of use.

### 2. Ease of use (Part 2, warning for setting up auto-run)

For launching the script easier, I included 2 (DANGEROUS!) methods that you can use.  
NOTE: You use these methods at your own risk, as they involve basic modification of the system.  
I have tested both, and I can confirm that they do not break anything (major).
The safer option is likely the best one to go with, as it involves launching the script  
via a command, rather than launching automatically whenever you load a Command Prompt window.  
That more dangerous option will break any other batch scripts that run.

### 3. Ease of use (Part 3, actually setting it up)

If this is your first time launching the program, you can set it up from the first time setup.  
For the rest of you who have been using this program already, you can go to Settings (8) and  
Auto-Run (3) to enter the auto-run settings menu.

### 4. Ease of use (Part 3, actually setting it up 2)

Now that you are in that menu, I highly recommend that you choose the safer option,  
as this involves adding it to the system PATH, which is 10x safer than the more dangerous option.  
Anyways, to use the safer option, press <kbd>S</kbd>, to use the more dangerous option (and please don't),  
press <kbd>D</kbd>.
